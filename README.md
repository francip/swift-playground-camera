swift-playground-camera
=======================

A sample Swift playground that demonstrates how to show camera preview and acquire camera frames

Note: Xcode 6.0.1 does not support OS X playgrounds. Xcode 6.1 supports OS X playgrounds, but `AVCaptureDevice.devices()` fails to enumerate the cameras for some reason, so the sample doesn't work.
